## Governance score

**Structural Gamma proxy:** 0.0

Only 0% of decision points are governed. The system is structurally ungoverned. The Drift Node is the global energy minimum.

> Structural proxy only — not runtime Gamma. Measures whether governance mechanisms are structurally present.

## Next steps

1. Fill in the null fields in `.verba/governance.yaml`
2. Complete the test stubs in `.verba/test_case_matrix.yaml`
3. Open in Verba Studio for AI-assisted policy authoring
4. Add `x-verba qa . --schema .verba/governance.yaml` to your CI/CD pipeline (coming v0.2)
