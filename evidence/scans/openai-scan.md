## Governance gaps

### 🔴 CRITICAL — `src\openai\lib\_realtime.py:43`

No checkpoint exists before the AI call at src\openai\lib\_realtime.py:43. The AI receives input and produces output with nothing checking whether it should — or what it can return.

**What is missing:** A mandatory checkpoint immediately before this AI call.

**Consequence if not addressed:** Any input reaches this AI call unfiltered. Any output proceeds to its destination unchecked. No governance record exists.

*VERBA term: Pre-Node gap*

### 🟡 HIGH — `src\openai\lib\_realtime.py:43`

AI output flows to 'downstream processing' with no human review detected.

**What is missing:** Human authorisation gate for critical severity outputs.

**Consequence if not addressed:** Every AI output reaches its destination automatically.

## Governance score

**Structural Gamma proxy:** 0.0

Only 0% of decision points are governed. The system is structurally ungoverned. The Drift Node is the global energy minimum.

> Structural proxy only — not runtime Gamma. Measures whether governance mechanisms are structurally present.

## Next steps

1. Fill in the null fields in `.verba/governance.yaml`
2. Complete the test stubs in `.verba/test_case_matrix.yaml`
3. Open in Verba Studio for AI-assisted policy authoring
4. Add `x-verba qa . --schema .verba/governance.yaml` to your CI/CD pipeline (coming v0.2)
