This command is coming in v0.2.

x-verba compile will turn your approved governance.yaml into a
machine-executable invariant bundle (.vsl) that the VERBA Runtime
loads and enforces at inference time.

Think of it as your governance build step — like tsc for TypeScript
or terraform plan for infrastructure. It validates before anything
goes live. The Priming Engine loads the bundle and begins monitoring.
Governance becomes provable, not claimed.
