This command is coming in v0.2.

x-verba prompt will generate governance-informed prompts for AI coding
tools. Tell Claude, Copilot, or Cursor what the code must never do —
before they write a single line. The generated code will have governance
structure baked in from the first line.

The same Identity Key and governance vocabulary runs through the full
lifecycle: what was prompted → what was generated → what was scanned
→ what was compiled → what the runtime enforced.
