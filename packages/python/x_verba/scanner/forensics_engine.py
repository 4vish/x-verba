This command is coming in v0.2.

x-verba forensics will reverse-engineer governance failures — taking
a codebase, incident logs, or post-mortem data and producing a full
DC decomposition: which failure modes were present, where governance
was absent, and what the remediation roadmap looks like.

The Knight Capital example:
  x-verba forensics ./knight-capital-reconstruction
  → DC-E14 Substrate Contamination detected
  → Pre-Node gap: activation_conflict_check missing
  → One VSL Eligibility Condition would have prevented $440M loss
